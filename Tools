This file is to generate a list of sources for the tools used in this software.

1. Datamuse.com's API (http://www.datamuse.com/api/)
  a. There is a python package "python-datamuse" (https://pypi.org/project/python-datamuse/) if deciding to use python to develop.
  b. This service can be used with up to 100,000 requests per day without an API key.  keep a log of overall requests made?
2. Use 7ESL list (https://7esl.com/texting-abbreviations/) to create a library list of common shorthand to work with.  
  a. Datamuse does not seem to catch popular internet/text shorthand (based on just one instance of searching of "wtf") so providing a pre-defined library will be best.
3. Use of Tweepy (https://docs.tweepy.org), twitter api package for python
  a. Personally most comfortable with Python, so I thought I'd check this out.  May try other languages if presented with better framework.


No other packages are identified as of yet, but the list will be updated as new tools are defined and used.
