This file is to generate a list of sources for the tools used or considered for the bot.
Ruled Out section will provide list of items removed from consideration and a simple explanation as to why.

Software:
  1. Datamuse.com's API
    a. There is a python package "python-datamuse" (https://pypi.org/project/python-datamuse/) if deciding to use python to develop.
    b. This service can be used with up to 100,000 requests per day without an API key.  keep a log of overall requests made?
    http://www.datamuse.com/api/
  2. Use 7ESL list  to create a library list of common shorthand to work with.  
    a. Datamuse does not seem to catch popular internet/text shorthand (based on just one instance of searching of "wtf") so providing a pre-defined library will be best.

  3. Use of Tweepy, twitter api package for python
    a. Personally most comfortable with Python, so I thought I'd check this out.  May try other languages if presented with better framework.
    https://docs.tweepy.org
  4. Possibly use javascript to create twitter bot, host via node.js stack.  
    a. Creating a twitter bot in javascript

    b. Creating a node.js stack

  5. PHP/Apache/etc based on usage of Synology NAS
    https://www.synology.com/en-us/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/Service_Application/How_to_host_a_website_on_Synology_NAS

Hardware:
  1. AWS Lamda (as a free way to host the bot until maturity) 
    https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/
  2. Heroku (another common platform to consider to host bots/web crawlers.)
    https://www.heroku.com/
  3. Personal Synology NAS as a a server to run bot
    (Not providing information on personal hardware within this spec.)

No other packages are identified as of yet, but the list will be updated as new tools are defined and used.
