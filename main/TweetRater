// The purpose of this file is to take the parsed/transformed tweet to work with Datamuse API.
// Each tweet will be assigned a rating for syllable count and how many words rhyme with the last word.
// Syllable count is to help keep a good flow when reading through separate tweets
// If a tweet has a last word that has only one or two identifiable rhyming words, it may be more difficult to find a match among the user's other tweets. 
//
// The idea is to construct a URL to ping that will return usable JSON information
// The following construction is based around the following:
// Starting url: https://api.datamuse.com/
// Appending for words that rhyme with forgetful	/words?rel_rhy=forgetful  (so, full link is https://api.datamuse.com/words?rel_rhy=forgetful)
// 
// There are metadata tags that add syllable count to the words from datamuse, thought I am not certain this will be an appropriate use to ping that consistently just for syllable count
//
// Found the following from searching through stack overflow:
// https://github.com/aparrish/pronouncingjs
// Javascript library to create syllable count of words
//
// Also from stack overflow
// https://stackoverflow.com/a/51175267
// A short piece of script that roughly calculates syllable count (though it is not fool proof)
