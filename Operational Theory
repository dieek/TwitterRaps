This file is intended to layout the rough idea behind the logic of the software created.

Current Scope is:
  1. One twitter handle/user per rap
  2. English language only 
  3. Max of 24 tweets to reply with

The current work flow is:
  1. Look up a particular handle/user when tagged in a particular tweet and see how many tweets they've made.
  2. Pull a majority/all tweets from that particular handle. (Not quite sure if there should be a limit.  Not certain how many users have have a massive amount of tweets.
  3. Parse all tweets to look for the following:
    a. Non-text based tweets to remove (pictures/links)
    b. Last word in the tweet
    c. Number of syllables of whole tweet
    d. Number of syllables of last word
 4. Create specific variable criteria to define tweet to help match to other tweets
    a. Ex. create an object "tweet" that has the parameters of "Syllables", "Last_Word_Syllables", "Last_Word_Rhyming" to programmatically evaluate and manage parsed information.
 5. Use Datamuse API (http://www.datamuse.com/api/) to retreive data based on values generated in item 4.
 6. When tweets have been sent to Datamuse, generate a way to rank responses to find best fitting tweets.
 7. After tweet order has been defined (not sure how to manage just yet), create shortcut links to tweets to use for posting.
 8. Reply
 
 
 How to interact with TwitterRaps handle:
 1. Choose handle to search using "@XXXXXXX" followed by how many tweets the rap should contain (ex 10)
 2. Check if twitter handle is real and if profile is available to be read.  If not, send a failure response ("I ain't seen this cat before.")
 2. If handle does not have enough tweets on their profile to sustain value given, send them a failure response ("Y'all need to come up with some better material.")
 3. If over twee limit send them a failure response ("Who you tryin' to play here? I don't work for free.")
 4. Check daily count for use of tools.  If API request (for datamuse) exceeds 100,000, send back failure response ("Yo, this homie's gotta take a break sometime.")
 5. If all parameters met appropriately, start process of analysing twitter handle data.
 
 How TwitterRaps will Reply:
 1. Tag handle that generated the request
 2. Generate generic response ("Aight, aight, we lookin' good!")
 3. Reply to that initial tweet with a link to the first tweet chosen with a countdown of which tweet it is.  Ex. (1/10)
 4. When overall rap chain has been completed, send link to survey for feedback on rap ("Yo, lemme know whatchu think.")
